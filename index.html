<p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Hi, my name is Justin! I am a student at Hunter College with a strong interest in exploring the intersection between media and technology.</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">I enjoy building and creating software that can help others, whether it is through internships or personal projects of my own.</p>
<p style="color:Tomato;">This website is a sample of the media projects that I have built experimenting using tools such as Photoshop and the Adobe Creative Suite. Hope y'all enjoy!</p>
